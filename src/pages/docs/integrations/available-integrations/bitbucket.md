## Backing up collections on Bitbucket

You can back up your Postman Collections to your Bitbucket repository. Once the integration is configured, any new changes to your collection in Postman will also appear in Bitbucket.

### Configuring a Bitbucket integration

To add a Bitbucket integration, navigate to your [Postman Dashboard](https://go.postman.co/). Select your desired workspace > **Integrations**. Click **Browse Integrations**, locate **Bitbucket**, and select **View Details**. Click **+ Add integration**.
