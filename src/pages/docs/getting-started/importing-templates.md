Templates help you to learn about APIs inside Postman. You can import templates into Postman to try out various request types and configurations. In addition to the templates, the Postman API Network includes collections you can use to make requests to popular third party APIs.

You can access the API Network and Templates on the web or inside Postman. To browse templates on the web, visit [explore.postman.com](https://explore.postman.com) or click **Explore** at the top left of Postman if you're using it in the browser. Click __Templates__ for community collections and __API Network__ for teams with published APIs.

[![Templates in browser](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/template-listings-in-browser.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/template-listings-in-browser.jpg)

> You can also access any collections added as part of your team's private API network by selecting __Team APIs__ on the left.

To find templates inside the Postman desktop app, click __New__ at the top left &gt; __Templates__ or __API Network__.

[![Templates in app](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/open-templates-in-app.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/open-templates-in-app.jpg)

You can browse using the categories or search for topics you're interested in.

* Selecting an API Network listing will display the team's API and template collection, from which you can also open the documentation or import into Postman.
* Selecting a template will bring up its listing, which contains additional detail including the publisher.

[![Templates detail](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/template-detail-opened.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/template-detail-opened.jpg)

If you want to see more detail on the requests in the template, click __View Documentation__. This will open the [docs page for the collection in the browser](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/), which outlines the requests inside it. To see more detail on the publisher, click their username, which will also open their profile in the browser, including other templates they have published.

To import a collection, click __Run in Postman__. This will import into a local copy of the collection that you can use and edit in Postman. Postman will display a notification to confirm the import.

The collection will appear in __Collections__ on the left.

Open the collection and click a request to open it. Depending on the template, you may be able to __Send__ the request straight away and receive a response.

[![Templates request response](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/template-request-sent-response.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/template-request-sent-response.jpg)

You can edit any of the request details in your copy of a collection and __Save__ your changes for future use as you can in [your own collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/).
