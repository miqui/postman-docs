A free Postman account allows you to [sync](/docs/getting-started/syncing/) and back up your work so that you can access it from different machines. You can also [collaborate](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/) with others on your API projects.

Signing up for an account is optional—you can continue to use the Postman app without an account if you prefer. Check out the [EULA](https://www.postman.com/licenses/postman_base_app), [security overview](https://www.postman.com/security), and [privacy policy](https://www.postman.com/licenses/privacy).

## Signing up for a Postman account

To use Postman on the desktop, [download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) the app and launch it.

Alternatively, navigate to Postman on the web at [go.postman.co/build](https://go.postman.co/build).

You will see a prompt to log in or sign up.

![App Sign In](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/pm-app-sign-in.jpg)

Click __Create Account__.

![App Sign Up](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/pm-app-sign-up.jpg)

You can sign up by entering an email, username, and password, or using your Google account.

To sign up by email, enter your details, check the box to agree to the __Terms of Use__ (which you can view by clicking the link), and click __Create free account__. Postman will send you an email to confirm your account—follow the instructions to complete your account setup.

To use your Google account to sign in to Postman, click __Sign up with Google__, and follow the instructions.

## Configuring your account

When you first sign up for a Postman account, you will be prompted to complete your profile.

![Configure account](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/configure-postman-account.jpg)

Enter your details and click __Continue__.

Enter your profile details and click **Save changes**.

>Your name will also be your username, and you will have the same username across all Postman elements, such as collections and documentation. You can [update your username](#updating-your-username) at any time.

![Edit profile](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Edit+profile.jpg)

>You can make your profile public. A public profile allows you to add your collections to Postman's [API Network](/docs/publishing-your-api/add-api-network/) and [Postman Templates](/docs/publishing-your-api/add-templates/).

You can optionally create or join a team. If you're signing up with your organization email and your company has a Postman account, you will see [teams you can join](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/#finding-teams-within-your-organization).

> Each account can be on one Postman team at a time. Multi-team collaboration and guest accounts are [on Postman's roadmap](https://trello.com/b/4N7PnHAz/postman-roadmap-for-developers).

[![Choose Team](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/join-team-from-list.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/join-team-from-list.jpg)

To create a team and optionally invite collaborators, click __Create new team__. Enter your team name and URL—click __Continue__.

[![Create Team](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/create-new-team-domain.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/create-new-team-domain.jpg)

You can invite collaborators to join your team now or later.

[![Invite to Team](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invite-to-new-team.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invite-to-new-team.jpg)

You can update your settings at any time by clicking your avatar in the top left of Postman.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/user-settings-menu.jpg" width="350px" alt="User Menu"/>

You can set a variety of profile details, including uploading a photo for your account, which will be visible to collaborators and anyone viewing resources you share or publish.

## Signing into Postman

To sign into Postman, enter your email / username and password and click __Sign In__ if you signed up by email, or __Sign in with Google__ if you used Google auth when signing up.

Check the __Keep me signed in__ box if you want to remain signed in after your current session. If you do not want Postman to retain your details or to remain signed in on the computer you are working on, uncheck the box.

![Stay signed in](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/stay-signed-in.jpg)

If you check the __Keep me signed in__ box, you will remain signed in for 30 days, and will need to re-authenticate after that period. If you uncheck the box, you will need to sign in again after 30 minutes.

## Syncing your work

When you are logged into Postman, you will see the sync indicator in the header bar.

![Sync icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/sync-icon.jpg)

When the icon is orange, you are connected to the servers and your work is backed up. The icon will turn blue and rotate when your work is being backed up, for example when you click the __Save__ button.

![Sync active](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/sync-active.jpg)

Postman will inform you if the sync is interrupted and will automatically try to re-establish the connection.

![Sync connection](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/sync-no-connection.jpg)

If a conflict arises from a sync issue within your workspace, [Postman will present options for resolving the conflict](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/conflicts/).

> Postman uses WebSockets for real-time [syncing](/docs/getting-started/syncing/). If you are experiencing issues with syncing, you can file an issue with the Postman [support center](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/en-us).

## Upgrading your account

If you have a free account, you can upgrade it by navigating to your [Postman Dashboard](https://go.postman.co/) and clicking **Upgrade** in the top-right corner.

If you have a paid account, you can upgrade your Postman plan by navigating to your [billing dashboard](https://app.postman.co/billing/overview) and clicking **...** > **Change Plan**.

[![change plan menu](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan-menu.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan-menu.jpg)

> The cost of your upgraded plan and/or additional seats will be prorated based on the time left in your team's current billing cycle. For more information, [contact Postman's sales team](mailto:sales@postman.com).

You can sign in to multiple accounts at the same time in Postman. Click your user avatar in the top right to toggle between accounts or click __Add a new account__ to sign in with another one.
